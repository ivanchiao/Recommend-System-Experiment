This is implemented by LMC_ZC.  
The experiments contains many models include BPRMF, NGCF, LR_GCCF, LightGCN.  
We consider *gowalla* dataset as an example.  
you should first run `data/preprocess.py` to process raw data.  
then run `main/*` to train model.  
also, you need to change the path in `main/*` to your own.  
folder `log` recoder the the training process.
